# My-Password-Manager
Sometimes, we all face problem remembering our passwords for different websites, accounts etc. Just created a simple Password manager that saves passwords for all the websites the user wants to. Tkinter has been used to create the GUI of the program, and a simple logic was used to generate password
## Modules used in the program
1) tkinter
2) time
3) random
### tkinter
The tkinter package is a thin object-oriented layer on top of Tcl/Tk. To use tkinter, you donâ€™t need to write Tcl code, but you will need to consult the Tk documentation, and occasionally the Tcl documentation. tkinter is a set of wrappers that implement the Tk widgets as Python classes

You can learn more about it in its documentation ðŸ‘‰ https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html
